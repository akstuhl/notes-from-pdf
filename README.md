# Notes from PDF package

This package for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) adds an alternative paste command, bound by default to ctrl-alt-v, with text processing designed to facilitate copying text from a PDF document as a quotation. This paste handling includes the following steps, each enabled via settings:
- Replace line breaks with spaces
- Repair line-break hyphenations
- Trim whitespace from start and end
- Change typographers' quotes/apostrophes to regular ones and replace double-quotes with single-quotes
